# Enlive [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cgrand/enlive.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cgrand/enlive)

Enlive is a selector-based (à la CSS) templating library for Clojure.

David Nolen wrote a [nice tutorial](http://github.com/swannodette/enlive-tutorial/).

Another [tutorial](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive/wiki/Table-and-Layout-Tutorial,-Part-1:-The-Goal by Brian Marick) is by Brian Marick.

There's a quickstart section in [Clojure Cookbook](https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/clojure-cookbook/blob/master/webapps/templating-with-enlive/templating-with-enlive.asciidoc).

## What's new in Enlive?

(most recent first)

### Auto-reloading (1.1.2)

```clj
(net.cgrand.reload/auto-reload *ns*)
```

Each time a resource or file used by a template/snippet is updated the
namespace is reloaded (as per `(require ... :reload)`).

### Misc

  * Perf improvements
  * Fixes to `${vars}` substitutions

### Pluggable parsers! (1.1.1)

The `*parser*` dynamic var controls the parser to be used by `html-resource` at
runtime. (or you can pass `{:parser XXX}` as an additional arg).

For templates and snippets whose sources are not read dynamically, you
can opt for another parser either locally:

```clj
(deftemplate ugh {:parser xml-parser}
  (java.io.StringReader. "<a><div>hello</div></a>")
  [])
```

or globally __for the declaring ns__:

```clj
(set-ns-parser! xml-parser)
```

A parser is a function from InputStream to nodes. `xml-parser`,
`net.cgrand.tagsoup/parser` and `net.cgrand.jsoup/parser` are the three
builtin ones.

### `${vars}` substitutions (1.1.1)

The following selector + function is going to replace any `${var}` in
text __and attributes__ by the value found in the map (or any function).

```clj
[:#container any-node] (replace-vars {:name "world" :class "hello"})
```

### hiccup-style helper (1.1.0)

```clj
(content (html [:h3#hello "Hello worls"]))
```

### older stuff

By default selector-transformation pairs are run sequentially. When you know
that several transformations are independent, you can now specify (as an
optimization) to process them in lockstep. Note that this doesn't work with
fragments selectors.

Example:

```clj
  [:a :selector] a-transformation
  [:another :selector] another-transformation
  [:a :dependent :selector] yet-another-transformation
```
If the first two transformations are independent you can rewrite this code as:

```clj
  :lockstep
  {[:a :selector] a-transformation
   [:another :selector] another-transformation}
  [:a :dependent :selector] yet-another-transformation
```

Transformations are now slightly restricted in their return values: a node or
a collection of nodes (instead of freely nested collections of nodes).

Dynamic selectors: selectors aren't compiled anymore. It means that you don't
need to wrap them in `(selector ...)` forms anymore nor to eval them in the most
dynamic cases.

Fragment selectors allow to select adjacent nodes. They are denoted by a map of
two node selectors (eg `{[:h1] [:p]}`), bounds are inclusive and they select
the smallest matching fragments.

Transformations (the right-hand parts of rules) are now plain old closures.
These functions take one arg (the selected node) and return nil, another node
or a collection of nodes.

Rules are applied top-down: the first rule transforms the whole tree and the
resulting tree is passed to the next rules.

Nodes are transformed deep-first, that is: if a selector selects several nodes,
descendants are transformed first. Hence, when the transformation is applied to
an ancestor, you can "see" the transformed descendants (but you can not see
your transformed siblings).

```
   /B                                                                             /(T B)
  A    if A and B are selected and transformed by T the the resulting tree is (T A      )
   \C                                                                             \C
```

## Concepts

`snippet` is a unit of your page. It may be logical or visual entry,
such as header, footer, page element. Snippet is usually a part of a
`template`, and may serve as a container for other snippets. For
example, for navigation on the web page. For that, let’s first define an
html template for the navigation. Snippets are created by using
`net.cgrand.enlive-html/defsnippet` function and, same as templates,
they require a corresponding HTML template file to be availble in a
classpath.

So, `snippet` function returns a seq of nodes, it can be used as a
building block for more complex templates.

`templates` combine snippets together, they serve like a basement for
the snippets. In order to create a template, you can use
`net.cgrand.enlive-html/deftemplate` function. `deftemplate` is used as
something what you would call layout in some other templating
systems. In essence, it’s either a self-contained page (rarely true in
bigger applications), or a container for snippets.

That said, a `template` is a returns a seq of string -- basically it's a
snippet whose output is serialized. Templates return a seq of strings to avoid
building the whole string.

Templates and snippets transform a source (specified as a path (to access
resources on the classpath), a File, a Reader, an InputStream, an URI, an URL,
an element or a seq of nodes).

Next concept is `selectors`, which are used within snippets and
templates to identify the block of HTML code the transformation would be
applied to. They’re very similar to CSS selectors, but also allow more
sophisticated, predicate-based selections, for example, you can select a
tag based on some part of content, or an attribute. Transformations are
functions that triggered on the elements found by selectors. They
receive content obtained selector, and modify it in some way.

## Quickstart tutorial

### Template

If you want to go see the compiled version of the following steps all in
one place, you can check out
[https://github.com/ifesdjeen/enlive-ring](an exmaple Ring application)

First thing you need to start, is to define your first template:

```clj
(require '[net.cgrand.enlive-html :as html])

(html/deftemplate main-template "templates/application.html"
  [])
```

Now, you can start writing selectors and transformations for the given
selectors. Let's add a title to the template. Given that your template
already has `<head>` and `<title>` tags, let's insert a title.

Content of `templates/application.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>This is a title placeholder</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

```clj
(html/deftemplate main-template "templates/application.html"
  []
  [:head :title] (html/content "Enlive starter kit"))
```

Here, `[:head :title]` is a selector, pretty much like a css
selector. If you're coming from jQuery, you can write same selector as
`$("head title")`. `html/content` is a transformation. It puts the
given content into the element specified by your selector.

### Snippet

Let's add several snippets. For example, navigation and some
content. For that, let's first define a template for the navigation.
Content of `templates/header.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Header placeholder</h1>
      <ul id="navigation">
        <li><a href="#">Placeholder for navigation</a></li>
      </ul>
    </header>
  </body>
</html>
```

```clj
(html/defsnippet main-template "templates/header.html"
  [:header]
  [heading navigation-elements]
  [:h1] (html/content heading)
  [:ul [:li html/first-of-type]] (html/clone-for [[caption url] navigation-elements]
                                                 [:li :a] (html/content caption)
                                                 [:li :a] (html/set-attr :href url)))
```

### Selectors

Enlive selectors can match either nodes or fragments (several adjacent nodes).

At the core, *every selector is a vector*. The items of this vector are called
*steps*.

A step is a predicate, for example `:h1`, `:p.some-class` or even
`(attr? :lang)`.

To select elements which match several predicates, you need to group
predicates into a vector: *inside steps, vectors mean "and"*. This may seem
confusing but the rule is simple: the outer-most vector hierarchically
chains steps, all other vectors denote intersection (and) between steps.

So `[:p (attr? :lang)]` is going to match any elements with a `lang` attribute
inside a `:p` element. On the other hand, `[[:p (attr? :lang)]]` is going to match
any `p` with a `lang` attribute.

Similarly, sets group predicates in an union. Hence *inside steps, sets mean
"or"*. So `[#{:div.class1 :div.class2}]` match every `div` which has either
`class1` or `class2`. This can alternatively be written
as `[[:div #{:.class1 .class2}]]`. Indeed you can have nested "ors" and "ands"
which means nested sets and vectors.

At the top level you can have a big "or" between selectors by wrapping several
selectors in a set. `#{[:td :em] [:th :em]}` is going to match any `em` insides
 either a `th` or a `td`. This is equivalent to `[#{:td :th} :em]`.

### Selector Syntax

See [syntax.html](http://enlive.cgrand.net/syntax.html)

Some examples:

```
Enlive                                       CSS
=======================================================
[:div]                                       div
[:body :script]                              body script
#{[:ul.outline :> :li] [:ol.outline :> li]}  ul.outline > li, ol.outline > li
[#{:ul.outline :ol.outline} :> :li]          ul.outline > li, ol.outline > li
[[#{:ul :ol} :.outline] :> :li]              ul.outline > li, ol.outline > li
[:div :> :*]                                 div > *
[:div :> text-node]                          (text children of a div)
[:div :> any-node]                           (all children (including text nodes and comments) of a div)
{[:dt] [:dl]}                                (fragments starting by DT and ending at the *next* DD)
```

## The `at` form

The `at` form is the most important form in Enlive. There are implicit `at`
forms in `snippet` and `template`.

```clojure
(at a-node
  [:a :selector] a-transformation
  [:another :selector] another-transformation
  ;; ...
  )
```

The right-hand value of a rule can be `nil`. It's the idiomatic way to remove an
element.

Transformations are closures which take one arg (the selected node) and return
`nil`, another node or an arbitrarily nested collection of nodes.

Rules are applied top-down: the first rule transforms the whole tree and the
resulting tree is passed to the next rules.

## Transformations

A transformation is a function that returns either a node or collection of node.

Enlive defines several helper functions:
```clojure
;; Replaces the content of the element. Values can be nodes or collection of nodes.
(content "xyz" a-node "abc")

;; Replaces the content of the element. Values are strings containing html code.
(html-content "<blink>please no</blink>")

;; Wraps selected node into the given tag
(wrap :div)
;; or
(wrap :div {:class "foo"})

;; Opposite to wrap, returns the content of the selected node
unwrap

;; Sets given key value pairs as attributes for selected node
(set-attr :attr1 "val1" :attr2 "val2")

;; Removes attribute(s) from selected node
(remove-attr :attr1 :attr2)

;; Adds class(es) to the selected node
(add-class "foo" "bar")

;; Removes class(es) from the selected node
(remove-class "foo" "bar")

;; Chains (composes) several transformations. Applies functions from left to right.
(do-> transformation1 transformation2)

;; Clones the selected node, applying transformations to it.
(clone-for [item items] transformation)
;; or
(clone-for [item items]
  selector1 transformation1
  selector2 transformation2)

;; Appends the values to the content of the selected element.
(append "xyz" a-node "abc")

;; Prepends the values to the content of the selected element.
(prepend "xyz" a-node "abc")

;; Inserts the values after the current selection (node or fragment).
(after "xyz" a-node "abc")

;; Inserts the values before the current selection (node or fragment).
(before "xyz" a-node "abc")

;; Replaces the current selection (node or fragment).
(substitute "xyz" a-node "abc")

;; Takes all nodes (under the current element) matched by src-selector, removes
;; them and combines them with the elements matched by dest-selector.
(move [:.footnote] [:#footnotes] content)
```

## Known limitations/problems

* No namespaces support (hence unsuitable for most XML)
